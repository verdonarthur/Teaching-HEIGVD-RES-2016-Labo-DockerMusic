# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2016-Labo-DockerMusic

## Admin

* You can work in teams of two students.
* You should fork and clone this repo. You should also configure an `upstream` repo, to be able to pull updates that we will publish in this original repo.
* There will not be a "full" lab grade for this long lab. However, there will *at least* one point to gain for the "salami" TE grade. Also, the skills that you will learn during this lab will be necessary for subsequent labs.
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on telegram or in the forum, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to get familiar with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in the previous lecture). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor should send a JSON payload containing the list of active musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 10 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![image](images/diagram.png)|
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | The Musician will send a UDP datagram every second. |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | The Auditor listen for UDP datatgrams. When a datagram is received the Auditor will save it and map the sound with the instrument. It will also flush the instruments inactive more than 5 seconds. |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | `{"uuid": "xxx", "sound": "xxx", "timestamp": "xxx"} `|
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | The sender has this structure: `var uuid, var sound, var timestamp`. The receiver will transform this structure into the following `var  uuid, var instrument, var activeSince` when it receive the datagram.|


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**?
| | With `JSON.stringify(object)`
|Question | What is **npm**?
| | npm is a package manager for JavaScript. You can use it to install, distribute code and also manage dependencies in your projects.
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?
| | This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. `--save` will make the package appear in the dependencies (inside package.json).
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?
| | We can use it to search and find some packages that can be usefull to make our application.
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122?
| | We can use the package `uuid` available on npm.
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis?
| | With `setInterval(callback, delay[, arg][, ...])`
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?
| | With the dgram module which provides an implementation of UDP Datagram sockets.
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**?
| | With `process.argv`: The first element will be 'node', the second element will be the name of the JavaScript file and the next elements will be any additional command line arguments.


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?
| | First we have to create a `Dockerfile`. See [Docker builder reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder)  and then use the command `docker build`.
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?
| | We can use it to execute our NodeJS package. It also allow to pass arguments to our package.
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?
| |With `docker run container_name`.
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?
| | With `docker ps â€“a`.
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?
| | With `docker stop container_name`.
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?
| | With the `tcpdump` utility or Wireshark.


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group?
| | With the event `on` in the UDP socket.
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?
| | By creating a new `Map()` object and by adding values into it with `myMap.set(key, value);`.
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?
| | We can use `moment()` to get the current time and `.format()` to format the date.
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?
| | We remove the inactive players when we receive a TCP request, just before sending the payload. To indentify the inactive players we check the `activeSince` value and if it's older than 5 second we remove it from the dictionary.
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?
| | With the `Server` class of `net` module. Which is used to create a TCP server.


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image?
| | We can launch an `Auditor` and some `Musician` container, make a tcp request on port `2205` and check that all the `Musician` are presents. After that we can kill one them and check if after 5 seconds it disappeared from the payload. We can also look the UDP Datagrams with `tcpdump-s0 -vv net [multicast_address]`.


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
